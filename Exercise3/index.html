            <p class = "bio">Hi I'm Dr. Steven Brule. I was born a baby to my mother Dorris Pringle-Brule. My daddy was a fry cook. I got my first job at a grocery store, name of Myer's Super Foods. I got my big break on TV when Channel 5 News made me the host of Stevie's Puppet Show. I was kicked off the air for scaring the kids, but Jan and Wayne Skylar, Channel 5's Married News Team brought me back on to be a reporter. I had my own segments: Brule's Rules and For Your Health. Then Channel 5 gave me another chance with my own show name of Check it Out with Dr. Steve. The series follows me exploring life's biggest questions and mysteries like how to ride skrateboards, what are words, planes, horses space, and more.</p>
